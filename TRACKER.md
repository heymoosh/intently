# Intently Hackathon Tracker

**Purpose:** First doc a new session reads to resume. Follows the project's own Tracker.md schema (see `docs/architecture/data-model.md`). Keep it slim — if it grows past ~100 lines, trim it.

## Status

**Phase:** Build.
**Status:** 🟡 On track.
**Last:** Expo app scaffolded in `app/` (TypeScript, Past/Present/Future `PagerView` shell, `react-native-markdown-display` rendering, stub voice button). Typecheck green.
**Next:** Managed Agents TS SDK wiring (skill loader: concat `agents/_shared/life-ops-conventions.md` + `agents/<skill>/SKILL.md` → agent definition).
**Last updated:** 2026-04-23

### Today's Go/No-Go (2026-04-23)

| Flow | Verdict | Top risk |
|---|---|---|
| Daily Brief | **BLOCK** | All 5 demo-critical criteria `unknown`; F-DB-03/04 need rework before evals can be authored |
| Daily Review | **BLOCK** | 5 demo-critical criteria `unknown`; 3 criteria have spec scope drift |
| Weekly Review | **BLOCK** | CR-wr-01 + CR-wr-02 directly contradict spec — must re-derive before any evals |

**Top 3 blockers:**
1. **CR-wr-01 + CR-wr-02 contradict spec** — decide qualitative vs numeric, then run `/derive-criteria weekly-review`
2. **All 11 demo-critical criteria `unknown`** — gates on today's Michael Cohen managed-agents session → ci.yml → eval datasets
3. **Stable-ID columns missing from Supabase** `projects`/`events`/`conversations`/`profiles` (HIGH, latent until Session 2)

**PRs needing review:** #2–#7 (build-loop, stacked — merge in order, 84/84 tests pass)
**Missing signals:** ai-eval-batch, spec-conformance, privacy routines produced no output for 04-23 (probable cause: working-tree conflict during build-loop iteration 5; see release-readiness report for diagnostic)

## Critical items awaiting review

*Populated by `release-readiness-steward` at 03:00 daily when overnight routines surface items that need human decision (not auto-fixable). Empty = nothing blocking. Per CLAUDE.md, Claude walks through these with Muxin at session start before substantive work.*

1. **Spec update: daily-review next-day preview + Weekly Goals read** *(not a decision, a spec catch-up)* — PR #19 added tomorrow-shaping to `agents/daily-review/SKILL.md`, and the criterion (CR-dr-05) was updated to match SKILL.md. The spec (`life-ops-plugin-spec.md:548-580`) was not updated to match, so criteria-sync flags the criterion as spec-drifted. Same issue on CR-dr-01 (drops Weekly Goals from reads; spec still lists it). Fix is a small spec edit (add a "next-day preview" step; decide Weekly Goals inclusion) then `/derive-criteria daily-review`. Queue for a live session Friday — sensitive wording, not overnight-safe. `docs/product/acceptance-criteria/daily-review.md`, `docs/product/requirements/life-ops-plugin-spec.md`

2. **NPM audit — markdown library swap (actionable); Expo SDK vuln (upstream-blocked)** — Two **independent** vuln chains. Fixing one does NOT fix the other:
   - **Actionable — swap `react-native-markdown-display` → `@expensify/react-native-markdown-display`.** Clears `markdown-it` < 12.3.2 ReDoS ([GHSA-6vfc-qv3f-vr6c](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6vfc-qv3f-vr6c)). Used only at `App.tsx:81` and in the planned journal editor's preview mode. Expensify fork maintains markdown rendering; no feature loss. **Scheduled for overnight iter 1 (2026-04-23).**
   - **Upstream-blocked — Expo SDK 54 internal toolchain.** Chain: `expo` → `@expo/cli` → `@expo/config-plugins` → `xcode` → `uuid` < 14 ([GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq)). Build-time only, not runtime (does not ship to end users). `npm audit fix --force` would downgrade expo to v46 — not viable. No action on our side. Fully blocked on Expo upstream.
   - **Consequence:** CI audit threshold stays at `high` until Expo upstream ships a patch, even after the markdown swap clears ~3-4 moderate advisories. Threshold cannot return to `moderate` this week.

*(Stale item removed 2026-04-23: "Spec decision: weekly-review scoring" — current CR-wr-02, spec step 2, and `agents/weekly-review/SKILL.md:25-27` all agree on qualitative-surface/quantitative-internal. No gap. Release-readiness report from earlier today was reading a criteria-sync snapshot from before PR #23's fix landed.)*

## Follow-ups (pending flight test / manual steps)

- **Promote overnight build loop to recurring** — ✅ DONE 2026-04-22/23 first flight: 6 PRs shipped, 84 tests, 0 failures. Add `build-loop` case to `~/.intently/bin/intently-routine.sh` + launchd plist at 23:30 daily. Watch first weeknight run for working-tree conflicts with active human branches.
- **Verify release-readiness 03:00 first fire** — ✅ DONE 2026-04-23. Report synthesized (see `release-readiness-2026-04-23.md`). Routine writer was blocked by working-tree conflict from build-loop iter 5 — fix: add git stash bracket or dedicated worktree to prevent overnight routine conflicts.
- **Verify auto-merge-safe.yml classifies correctly** — runs after any `auto/*` PR triggers `security.yml`. Fastest test path: `launchctl kickstart gui/$(id -u)/com.intently.privacy` to force a real draft PR from the privacy steward, then watch GitHub Actions tab. Mechanical paths should auto-merge; docs should flip ready + get `needs-muxin-review` label; code should stay draft. `--admin` flag bypasses branch protection (there is none yet).
- **Delete stale remote branch** — `git push origin --delete feat/slim-claude-md` (old branch name before this session's rescope; current session committed on `feat/mvp10-scaffold-and-infra`). Safe — no unique commits on the old remote.
- **Thursday 2026-04-23 post-stack-decision** — wire `ci.yml` (lint, typecheck, unit tests, build) per stack. Then update `auto-merge-safe.yml` to move code PRs from "stays draft" to "auto-merge on ci.yml + security.yml both green." That completes the "auto-fix anything that can be fixed without me" intent.

## Next (in order — start here)

1. **Managed Agents TS SDK.** Install, wrap skill loading (concat `agents/_shared/life-ops-conventions.md` + `agents/<skill>/SKILL.md` → agent definition).
2. **Google OAuth app registration.** Calendar + Gmail scopes.
3. **Tool implementations.** `read_calendar`, `read_emails`, `read_file`, `write_file` — Edge Functions calling Supabase or Google APIs.
4. **`pg_cron` schedules** tied to config times (`daily_brief_time`, `daily_review_time`, `weekly_review_day`/`weekly_review_time`).
5. **Demo seed data.** Realistic Goals, Monthly Goals, Weekly Goals, 2–3 projects, a week of Daily Log and journal entries.
6. **Record three demo flows end-to-end.** Hindsight self-host on Fly — only if time allows.
7. **Submission.** README, demo video, "how we used managed agents" narrative.

## Open questions (resolve as we hit them)

- **Managed Agents waitlist approval timing.** Blocks Memory feature usage. Agents still run without it (re-read Layer 1 each invocation).
- **`vault_ids` vs Bitwarden reconciliation.** Anthropic's session-credential pattern may conflict with our Bitwarden-only secrets rule. Resolve during backend scaffold.
- **Demo target surface:** physical phone, simulator screencap, or web browser. Changes polish budget.
- **Thursday 2026-04-23 Michael Cohen session.** Managed Agents specifics. Bring: scheduling pattern confirmation, `vault_ids` question, any surprise constraints on tool-use.

## Locked decisions (do not re-litigate — see ADRs for reasoning)

- **MVP scope:** 5 skills — `setup`, `daily-brief`, `update-tracker`, `daily-review`, `weekly-review`.
- **Demo flows:** daily brief, daily review, weekly review.
- **Stack (ADR 0003):** Expo + TypeScript · Supabase (Postgres + Storage + Auth + `pg_cron` + Edge Functions) · Managed Agents TS SDK · Expo Speech STT · Hindsight self-hosted on Fly (~$5/mo) · Bitwarden Secrets Manager.
- **Managed Agents is runtime, not state (ADR 0001).** State of truth = Markdown in Supabase. Memory feature, if approved, is a cache.
- **Per-user data store = Supabase (ADR 0002).** No external note-app integration in V1.
- **Calendar/email via direct OAuth → Google APIs.** MCP deferred to V2.
- **Deferred to backlog:** Honcho, OpenClaw, Hermes, Cyrano, Discord routing, game reskinning, gamification, somatic exercises, kanban/Gantt, monthly-review, daily-triage, project-continue, session-digest, vault-drift-check, notes-action-sync.

## How to resume in a new session

Point a new Claude session at this file:

> Read `TRACKER.md` first. Then `CLAUDE.md` for repo rules. Then jump to the `Next` section.

Update the **Status** block and prepend a dated **Log** entry below at the end of every non-trivial session.

## Log

### 2026-04-23 (security session)
- Added `deps-audit` job to `security.yml` (PR #29, merged): `npm audit --audit-level=high` on every PR + nightly, parallel with gitleaks.
- Added npm audit pre-commit check (check 5 in `.githooks/pre-commit`) and `.github/dependabot.yml` (PR #31, open): audit runs only when `package.json`/`package-lock.json` are staged; dependabot sweeps weekly on Mondays.
- Audit threshold is `high` not `moderate` — 12 pre-existing moderate vulns in two upstream chains. Root 1 (`react-native-markdown-display` → `markdown-it`) is actionable (swap to Expensify fork). Root 2 (Expo SDK toolchain → `xcode` → `uuid`) is fully upstream-blocked. Decision on Root 1 flagged in Critical items #3.

### 2026-04-22 (continued)
- Wrote `supabase/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql`: 6 tables (`profiles`, `life_ops_config`, `markdown_files`, `conversations`, `projects`, `events`), RLS owner-only on every user-scoped table, signup trigger auto-populates `profiles`. JSONB on `life_ops_config.config`, `conversations.turns`, `projects.metadata`, `events.metadata` so Thursday's managed-agents session learnings land as ALTERs not rewrites.
- Resolved ambiguity: `events` scoped as the Ops Plan "Time-Sensitive" mirror for V1 (not the backlog agent-run-log reading).
- Wrote `supabase/README.md`: apply instructions, known post-Thursday touch-points (`agent_run_id` on conversations, `vault_ids`/Bitwarden reconciliation, `pg_cron` schedule rows).
- Installed Supabase CLI (`brew install supabase/tap/supabase`), `supabase login`, `supabase init`, `supabase link --project-ref cjlktjrossrzmswrayfz`, `supabase db push` — migration applied to remote cleanly (pgcrypto pre-installed, handled by `if not exists`).
- Scaffolded Expo app at `app/` (blank-typescript template, Expo SDK 54). Installed `react-native-markdown-display`, `expo-speech`, `react-native-pager-view` via `npx expo install`.
- Built `app/App.tsx`: Past/Present/Future `PagerView` shell, `initialPage={1}` (Center default), each screen scrolls placeholder markdown rendered by `react-native-markdown-display`, overlay voice button (stub — alerts "voice coming soon" pending STT wiring; note that Expo Speech is TTS, true STT will need `expo-speech-recognition` or similar). `tsc --noEmit` clean.

### 2026-04-22
- Docs cleanup: trimmed `agent-memory.md` to V1 scope; moved cross-agent vision, game reskinning, and full memory schema to `docs/backlog/`.
- ADRs 0001 (managed-agents-as-runtime), 0002 (Supabase), 0003 (V1 stack with revisit triggers) written.
- Managed Agents MCP + tool-use patterns confirmed via Anthropic docs; scheduling will be owned by our backend (`pg_cron`).
- Hindsight confirmed MIT; self-host on Fly — can defer for demo if time-pressed.
- Setup skill drafted from scratch at trimmed scope (goals + projects + week seed + optional OAuth).
- Four source-imported skills adapted: hardcoded paths, personal references, and source-platform-specific patterns all removed.
- `life-ops-conventions.md` slimmed to ~50 lines — global rules only; per-skill concerns moved into each `SKILL.md`.
- Waitlist submission for Managed Agents Memory/Orchestration/Outcomes.
